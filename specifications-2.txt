If you encounter rendering issues in the Program Output panel, try clicking “Reset” in the upper right hand corner. If there are still issues, do a full page refresh.

Avoid using JQuery - we want to see you write your own custom JS.

Challenges:
You have been provided with some basic HTML, CSS and JS.

Build on this to provide implementations to the following challenges.

Extra points will be allocated for implementation quality, coding style and UI design.

1. Slideshow
Build a fully functional slideshow (carousel) in the placeholder provided. The slideshow slides should be based on the data returned from the following API call: https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20200528/test.json

You need to call the API, parse the response and create a slideshow using the data. Add a counter on each slide so that a user can see current slide number. Overlay headline text (“title_a”) and summary (“summary”) (truncate to 50 characters) and make style appropriately.

2. Expose Browser Information
Implement a modal dialog which displays any information that is available to a developer on the client. List the information in a human readable, user-friendly format. Clicking on the “Display Browser Information” button should invoke this modal.

3. Newsletter Sign-up Form
Add functionality to our “Let us send you our newsletter” module which will validate user input email address and message the user appropriately on valid or invalid inputs.

4. Optimize code for browser
Study the markup on the page and optimize the code based on the following criteria: page performance, standards-based best practice and general frontend development best practice.
